##### About us

> We are an association of the University of Geneva that aims to share its passion for data science and computer science. We have a strong interest in statistics and computational methods. Initially, the association's target audience was people in the social sciences but we quickly expanded into other fields of research.
<br><br> More concretely, the association aims to achieve its objectives by creating freely-accessible educational content on its platforms in a variety of forms: YouTube videos, blog posts, exercises, etc. The association co-organizes the R-Lunches, a series of events related to R in which various speakers present topics related to the R language. The association tries to keep abreast of and participate as often as possible in digital initiatives at the University of Geneva.
