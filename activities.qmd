# 😁WeData’s social life

[Discord](https://discord.gg/HSaVUsq8YD)

The association has a social life both online via WhatsApp, discord and in real life. This involves chatting about specific topics, sharing information and experience, and asking and answering questions. There's also the more social aspect of meeting other embers face-to-face.

## If you want to help you can…

- Share valuable information
- Engage online (discuss, ask or reply to questions, etc.)
- Stay curious and share new ideas or discoveries

# 🥪R-Lunches

[website](http://use-r-carlvogt.github.io/prochains-lunchs/)

Every semester we organize 3 to 5 meetings around R in the University of Geneva. R-Lunches take place every first Tuesday of the month between 12:15 and 13:30. We invite presenters to talk about a topic of their choice. Every semester we have between 3 to 5 sessions and we can afford funds for food and speakers’ travel expense.

## If you want to help you can…

- Suggest speakers for the next semester
- Be the speaker for one session
- Communicate the event

# 🗣️Workshops and Conferences

The association organizes free in-house workshops. No specific requirements apply to the content of these workshops except that it has to be related to the association theme. They can take place face-to-face or remotely via a Zoom link, for example.

# 📽️YouTube

One of the association's main objectives is educational. Indeed, the aim is to share our passion with interested people. Our main platform is our YouTube channel. We currently publish one video per week on the theme of data sciences and computer science. All our videos are in French (subtitles in english, german, italian, spanish, arabic and kinyarwanda), but we're open to other languages and many subjects.
